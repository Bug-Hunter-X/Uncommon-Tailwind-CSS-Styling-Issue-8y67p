# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Tailwind CSS where a component's styling does not apply as expected.  The issue is not related to syntax errors or missing dependencies. The challenge lies in identifying the root cause of the unexpected rendering behavior.

## Bug Description

The `SomeComponent.js` file contains a simple component with Tailwind CSS classes.  However, the component renders incorrectly, displaying elements with different styling than expected based on the applied classes. The issue isn't directly caused by conflicting classes or incorrect syntax, which makes it uncommon and difficult to debug.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `SomeComponentSolution.js`, addressing the root cause of the styling issue by using a simple trick that avoids any further issues related to Tailwind classes and how they are implemented.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the application (a simple way would be to integrate the component into a React app) and observe the unusual styling of the component.
5. Compare the original component with the solution provided to understand the fix.
